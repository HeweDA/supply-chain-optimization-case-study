# Supply Chain Optimization Case Study

📦 Project Overview
This project analyzes a retail company’s supply chain operations to identify opportunities for efficiency improvement, cost reduction, and enhanced delivery performance. The dataset includes detailed information on supply-to-*environment execution* such as sales and quality performance for multiple product categories.

```5
- Delivery performance by shipment mode and region
- Product-level updates in inventory flow, cost, and profit
- Return patterns and their impact on profitability
- Sales performance across customer segments and regions
➡️ tools: **Python**, **Pandas**, **Power BI**

---

📊 Dataset
The dataset contains over **20,000 rows** and **29 columns**, including attributes like:
- Order and shipment dates
- Delivery times (days)
- Customer and product details
- Cost, sales, return status, and profit metrics
- Location-based data (city, state, region)

This enables multifaceted analysis of:
- **Inventory turnover**
- **Lead time fluctuations**
- **Return impact on revenue**
- **Regional performance metrics**

---

🔧 Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Power BI** (dashboard creation)
- **Git/GitHub** for version control
- *(Optional)*: SQL for database exploration

---

🧠 Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**  
   Handle missing values, format dates, and calculate delivery duration.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Identify trends in shipping, delivery inefficiency, return rates, and cost-profit correlations.
3. **Insight Generation**  
   Create visual summaries and operational recommendations.
4. **Dashboard Visualization**  
   Power BI dashboard showcasing KPIs (download available in `/dashboard` folder).
5. **Conclusion & Future Work**  
   Summarize business insights and suggest extensions such as demand forecasting or outlier handling.
